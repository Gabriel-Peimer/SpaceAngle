# Space Angle
Space Angle is a mobile game available on the Google Play Store. In the game the player controls a space ship and steers it to avoid hitting meteors. The game provides a functioning Shop in which the player can purchase upgrades (no in-app purchasing).
The game was created by Gabriel Peimer (at the time a fifteen year old, so please excuse the possibly messy code).
Logo design by Eitan Fishman. Eitan Fishman also acted as a user interface consultant for the duration of the project.
